Sparse PUFs: -
We have provided you with data from a Sparse CDU PUF with D = 2048 and S = 512 i.e. only 512 of the 2048 CDUs are actually active and the rest 1536 are disconnected and play no role in response generation. However, it is not known which 512 CDUs are active. A total of 1600 CRPs have been provided to you. 
The file train_challenges.dat contains 1600 lines each line giving a string of 2048 bits denoting the challenge. The file train_responses.dat containing 1600 lines each line giving the response obtained on those challenges in the form of delay in microseconds. Note that numbers provided in train_challenges.dat are bits i.e. either 0 or 1 whereas those in train_responses.dat are floating point numbers. 
Note that the number of training CRPs (N = 1600 in this case) was deliberately kept small by Melbo (note
that N â‰¤ D) to make the problem challenging.
